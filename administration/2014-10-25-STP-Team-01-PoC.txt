Several mobile devices (three or four) will be connected to a WiFi network, either a mobile hotspot or for testing purposes a dedicated WiFi router. The devices will establish communications with each other automatically upon our app being opened. On each device a boolean logic expression, including integer comparisons, will be displayed. Text fields, spinners, or dropdown menus will be presented in the UI of the app, which allow for values to be assigned to the various variables within the displayed expression. As the values of these variables are changed in real-time, the monitoring algorithm running on each device will independently verify the state of the expression and determine if it is satisfied, violated, or indeterminate. This result will be displayed within the app UI as well.
