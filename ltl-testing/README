Install SPOT. It's in the AUR for Arch users ("spot"). Install GraphViz as well if you want
to be able to view the automata graphically.

Use something like the following to generate an LTL formula:

randltl --seed="$(date +%s)" --spin A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V > formulae

Or, write one by hand.

Then do this:

DEPRECATED: ltl2tgba -F formulae --lenient -B | tee automaton | dot -Tpdf > graph.pdf && xdg-open graph.pdf

./formula_to_automaton.sh "$FORMULA" | ./automaton_to_pdf.sh

To convert the LTL formula into a Buchi Automaton and display it with GraphViz. The BA
will also be stored in the file 'automaton' in GraphViz format, which should be fairly
easy to parse and turn into a graph structure within our Java implementation.
