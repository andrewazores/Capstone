Use something like the following to generate an LTL formula:

randltl --seed="$(date +%s)" --spin A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V > formulae

Or, write one by hand.

Then do this:

ltl2tgba -F formulae --lenient -B | tee automaton | dot -Tpdf > graph.pdf && xdg-open graph.pdf

To convert the LTL formula into a Buchi Automaton and display it with GraphViz. The BA
will also be stored in the file 'automaton' in GraphViz format, which should be fairly
easy to parse and turn into a graph structure within our Java implementation.
