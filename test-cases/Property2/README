This directory contains the test cases that Menna supplied. The test is for the following LTL property:

¬(leader.rescue) U (∀i : odd(i) :: UAV i.spots subject)

Which means:

"That is, the leader should not issue the rescue command
until all the odd ranked UAVs make visual confirmations
of spotting the rescue subject. Obviously, only the leader
and the odd ranked processes participate in the property.
Fig. 5b shows the LTL3 monitor automaton for Property
2 for 4 UAVs, where proposition a denotes spots subject
and b denotes rescue. It is expected that the leader monitor
process would perform more work than other processes for
this property as well."

Her description of the contents is as follows:

2x2: experiment with 4 nodes (UAVs aligned in a 2x2 grid)
      0: folder containing files supplied to process 0
               conjunct_mapping: CSV file with conjunct, owner process
               initial_state.my: CSV file with owner process, conjunct, initial value (don't think you will need it)
               automaton.my: the automaton in the agreed format.
               mission (ignore)
...

2x2_timeline: folder with the resulted traces for the 4 nodes experiment
              0.trace: the trace file generated by process 0
....

The trace file looks something like this:
......
1420336904,MSG_RECV,2
1420336904,VEC_CLK,33,37,54,54,57,51,47,56,56,44,29,28
1420336904,VAR_UPDATE,p0_in_cp0_radius,0
1420336904,VAR_UPDATE,p0_in_cp1_radius,1
.....
first field is timestamp at which the event was logged, second field is type of event, third field depends on the event type.
for example:
1420336904,MSG_RECV,2
indicates that the process received a message from process 2.


1420336904,VEC_CLK,33,37,54,54,57,51,47,56,56,44,29,28
indicates the new vector clock (comma separated n processes)

1420336904,VAR_UPDATE,p0_in_cp0_radius,0
indicates that the conjunct p0_in_cp0_radius value has changed to 0

1420336904,SEND_STATE_TO_MONITOR
indicates that the process sent the state (valuation of all conjuncts + vector clock) to the monitor

1420336909,SEND_MESSAGE_TO_PROCESS,2
indicates that the process sent a message to process 2


1420336922,ADD_GLOBAL_STATE,q3
1420336922,REMOVE_GLOBAL_STATE,q0

indicates that the monitor added/removed (respectively) a global state at automaton state q3/q0
